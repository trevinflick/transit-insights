# Restore a history DB snapshot from Cloudflare R2.
#
# A backup you've never restored is a guess, not a backup — run this
# periodically to prove the chain works end to end.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/restore-db.sh --list                 # list available snapshots
#   scripts/restore-db.sh                         # fetch the latest snapshot
#   scripts/restore-db.sh history-20260603-041700.sqlite.gz   # a specific one
#
# By design this NEVER overwrites the live DB. It downloads, decompresses,
# and integrity-checks into tmp/db-backups/, then prints the path and the
# manual swap-in steps. Swapping the live DB is a deliberate, stop-the-bots
# operation you do by hand.
#
# Env overrides:
#   RCLONE_REMOTE   rclone "remote:bucket"   (default: r2:cta-db-backups)
