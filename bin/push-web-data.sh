# Publish updated alert data to the R2 data origin and trigger a site rebuild.
#
# Replaces the old git-commit-to-Pages flow. The high-churn data files now live
# in R2 (served at https://data.chicagotransitalerts.app), so data refreshes no
# longer create commits or run a deploy. A rebuild is only needed to refresh the
# prerendered per-incident OG cards / CSV / feed — fired here as a GitHub
# repository_dispatch when the data actually changed, with the Actions schedule
# as the catch-up net.
#
# Invoked both by cron (catch-up) and event-driven (src/shared/webPushTrigger.js
# spawns it ~30s after a new Bluesky post). No-ops when the freshly exported data
# is byte-identical to the last successful upload, so neither the upload nor the
# rebuild fires on unchanged ticks.
#
# Env:
#   CTA_INSIGHTS          repo path (default: parent of this script's dir)
#   RCLONE_REMOTE         rclone remote:bucket (default: r2web:cta-alert-history-data)
#   DISPATCH_REPO         owner/repo to rebuild (default: cailinpitt/chicago-transit-alerts)
#   GITHUB_DISPATCH_TOKEN PAT allowed to POST repository_dispatch on DISPATCH_REPO.
#                         If unset, the upload still happens and a warning is
#                         logged — the scheduled rebuild will catch up.
