# healthchecks.io monitoring (optional). Only the slugs in HC_MONITORED ping

# free tier and is the committed source of truth for "what's watched" — edit it
# here and `git pull` on the server to widen/narrow coverage. Jobs not listed
# simply don't ping. (push-web-data isn't run via this wrapper; it pings from
# its own script.) No-op entirely unless cron/healthchecks.env exists (see the
# .example).

# exists; see cron/healthchecks.env.example for tuning the auto-created defaults).
