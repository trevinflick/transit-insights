/**
 * Compute a static-map view for a train gap event. Reuses the train bunching
 * framing (bbox, station picks, direction arrow) by treating the leading and
 * trailing trains as a two-train "bunch", then exposes the polyline segment
 * between them as `gapPath` so the frame renderer can dash it over the route.
 *
 * Diverges from bunching framing in two ways:
 *   1. Strips every station pin/label except the two stations immediately
 *      flanking the gap (one just outside each train). Bunching keeps a dense
 *      pin field for context; gaps want the eye to land on the gap stretch.
 *   2. Renders the gap stretch as a dashed line in the line's own color (drawn
 *      in the SVG layer by renderTrainBunchingFrame) instead of a solid
 *      highlight hue, so it reads as a break in the route rather than a stripe.
