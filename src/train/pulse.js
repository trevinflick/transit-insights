// Detects dead segments on a rail line: stretches where no train has appeared
// recently enough that something is probably wrong. Pure function — no DB
// writes; persistence/cooldown gating lives in the bin script.

// Each branch is binned by along-track distance; a bin is "cold" when no
// train has projected into it within max(2.5× headway, 15 min) — the
// multiplier lets the threshold open up during sparse off-peak service while
// the floor keeps peak detection from getting jumpy. Loop lines
// (Brown/Orange/Pink/Purple) split into outbound/inbound branches sharing
// geometry but filtered by Train Tracker direction code, so single-direction
// outages don't get masked by trains running the other way.
//
// A candidate is admitted via any of three paths (composite gate):
//   passLong  — run length ≥ 2 mi (sparse outer-branch fallback)
//   passMulti — ≥ 2 stations completely inside the cold run
//   passSolo  — ≥ 1 station + ≥3 expected-but-missed trains + ≥3× headway
//               cold time (excludes held-train false positives)
// Returns { skipped, candidates } so the bin can distinguish "no signal"
// (don't touch existing pulse_state) from "all clear" (advance clear ticks).
